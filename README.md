## Heavily WIP - This mod is still being tested!

# PersistentPrecepts
Persistent Precepts is a mod for Rimworld which allows you to prevent the re-randomization of Ideology precepts, rituals, buildings etc. when you change the structure or memes. With this mod, you can ensure that your carefully crafted Ideology remains intact, even if you go back and change structure/memes.

### Done:
-Toggle that blocks precept randomization

### To do:
-Update the Mod Settings menu

-Update Dialogue window warning about Precept Randomization when changing memes.
