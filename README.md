# Persistent Precepts
Persistent Precepts is a mod for Rimworld which allows you to prevent the re-randomization of Ideology precepts, rituals, buildings etc. when you change the structure or memes. With this mod, you can ensure that your carefully crafted Ideology remains intact, even if you go back and change structure/memes.

### Done:
-Toggle that blocks precept randomization (added to both ideoligion edit screen and mod settings option)
-Toggle only blocks precept randomization on player initiated action. This prevents the toggle from blocking precept generation when the game generates faction ideologies.

### To do:
-Update Dialogue window warning about Precept Randomization when changing memes.
